### A Flutter Package for adding Floating bubbles in the Foreground to a widget.

## Getting Started

In your flutter project(in pubspec.yaml) add the dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  floating_bubbles: ^2.6.2
```

Import the package:

```dart
import 'package:floating_bubbles/floating_bubbles.dart';
```

## Usage

Here is an snippet on how to use Floating Bubbles to any Widget.

### Creating FloatingBubbles() (this creates the animation and plays for amount of time you give as the duration.)

```dart
 return Stack(
    children: [
     Positioned.fill(
        child: Container(
        color: Colors.red,
      ),
     ),
     Positioned.fill(
         child: FloatingBubbles(
         noOfBubbles: 25,
         colorsOfBubbles: [
            Colors.green.withAlpha(30),
            Colors.red,
         ],
         sizeFactor: 0.16,
         duration: 120, // 120 seconds.
         opacity: 70,
         paintingStyle: PaintingStyle.stroke,
         strokeWidth: 8,
         shape: BubbleShape.circle, // circle is the default. No need to explicitly mention if its a circle.
         speed: BubbleSpeed.normal, // normal is the default
    ),
 );
```

---

### Creating FloatingBubbles.alwaysRepeating() (Creates Floating Bubbles that always floats and doesn't stop.)

```dart
return Stack(
   children: [
    Positioned.fill(
       child: Container(
       color: Colors.red,
     ),
    ),
    Positioned.fill(
        child: FloatingBubbles.alwaysRepeating(
        noOfBubbles: 25,
         colorsOfBubbles: [
            Colors.green.withAlpha(30),
            Colors.red,
         ],
        sizeFactor: 0.16,
        opacity: 70,
        paintingStyle: PaintingStyle.fill,
        shape: BubbleShape.square,
        speed: BubbleSpeed.normal,

   ),
);
```
